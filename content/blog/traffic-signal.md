## Project

Learn how to mimic traffic lights with 3 LEDs.

This project comes with code and instructions for both arduino and raspberry pi. 

Both versions do the same thing, so you can also compare how these 2 programs differ.

## What you need

- 1x breadboard
- 3x LEDs: Red, Yellow, Green
- 3x 150 ohm resistors
- 1x Arduino or Raspberry pi
- Jumper wires

## Repository and detailed instructions

See [iyp-uk/traffic-signal](https://github.com/iyp-uk/traffic-signal) on github.
